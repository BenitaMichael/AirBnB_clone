# AIRBNB CLONE PROJECT
## Project Description:
This is the first section of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project with the help of the cmd module in python.

Data (python objects) stored in files generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the json module in python

## Description of the command interpreter:
A command line interpreter allows the user to interact with a program using commands in the form of text lines. Our command line interpreter functions like the Bash shell except that it recognizes a limited number of commands that were solely defined and implemented for the purposes of the AirBnB website.
This command line interpreter  serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:
- create
- show ( read )
- count
- update
- destroy

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:
-   Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
-   Retrieving or reading an object from a file, a database etc…
-   executing several operations(count, compute stats, etc…)
-   Updating of an object
-   Destroying an object

## How to start it
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine (Linux distro) for development and testing purposes.
